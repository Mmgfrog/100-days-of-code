# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used Visual Basic with Excel in attempt to automate data parsing.

**Thoughts:** This is a mini-assignment from a potential employer. I know nothing about VB and am trying to learn via Lynda.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 2: Dec. 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More work on VB and Excel project.

**Thoughts**: I found some helpful links online about using VB. Tried unsuccessfully to use them in my mini-assignment. Submitted what I had accomplished.

**Link(s) to work**: NA


### Day 3: Dec. 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Back to Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts** I have completed Caesar's Cipher but needed a lot of help. However, I have gotten better at algorithms overall through this section.

**Link(s) to work**
1. https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/caesars-cipher


### Day 4: Jan. 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed API section of Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts:** This was basically a copy-paste section and I know I will have to go back over this when I try to implement for real.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/trigger-click-events-with-jquery plus 6 more lessons


### Day 5: Jan. 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with jQuery and worked on Random Quote Machine. Realized I will use an API for random quotes.

**Thoughts**: Good to review jQuery and rather than hard-coding quotes, decided to try using first API.

**Link(s) to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


### Day 6: Jan. 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back over the API instructional section, took notes, and found the free API I want to try.

**Thoughts**: Time-consuming but also time well-spent.

**Link(s) to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 7: Jan. 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More with API and Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts**: Read about helpful advice on Free Code Camp forum for implementation. Also Bootstrapped all the HTML and CSS.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 8: Jan. 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jacked up 100 Days Of Code repo at least twice, so I spent time reviewing Git/GitHub. Also realized I needed to do housekeeping with this Log and to keep commits going to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: If I were pushing code to a central repo and wanting it to be merged, my repo would have been right. Instead I need to just set up and merge my own stuff, like I created my own Algorithms repo.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/Mmgfrog


###Day 9: Jan. 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got $.getJSON and jQuery somewhat working on Random Quote Machine, plus minor CSS changes.

**Thoughts**: How to randomize quotes and not just pull one at a time? How to cycle through API's array? How to get Twitter functionality working?

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 10: Jan. 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Saw Hidden Figures and was inspired to keep going with coding. Fortran, anyone?

**Thoughts**: Why am I doing this? What are my motivators?

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 11: Jan. 8, 2017
**Day Off**


###Day 12: Jan. 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Scrapped quotes API because I couldn't get it to randomize and return properly. Wrote JavaScript code for an array of quotes which are selected at random one at a time. Will use API for Twitter part of project instead.

**Thoughts**: Frustrated by this project that seems simple but isn't turning out to be. Happy that I got a quote to return at random from an array. Sad that I can't bring it into the view on button click yet.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 13: Jan. 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Code is working for random quotes displaying to view! Helpful advice from Free Code Camp forum.

**Thoughts**: Getting quite an education by going through API documentation for Twitter. Very interesting. Taking notes.

**Link to work**:Twitter API info here https://dev.twitter.com/basics/things-every-developer-should-know


###Day 14: Jan. 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Encouraged others and networked. Making notes on security for tweeting quotes.

**Thoughts**: Glad to make friends online with other coders and developers. Networking is important although outside my comfort zone.

**Link to work**: Twitter Security info: https://dev.twitter.com/basics/security-best-practices


###Day 15: Jan 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Searched for free wireframe tool, downloaded WinSCP to start learning about remote hosting, and read more about Twitter API usage.

**Thoughts**: I need to prioritize. Finish Random Quote Machine in order to post to portfolio. Wireframe for possible part-time job. Both important.

**Link to work**: Twitter documentation, took notes


###Day 16: Jan. 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitter API objects, more reading and note-taking. Fascinating!

**Thoughts**: The Twitter database must be vast. So many object properties per account/tweet/entity etc.

**Link to work**: API overview https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api and subsequent section


###Day 17: Jan 14, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 18: Jan. 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tweets, Users, Entities, etc. More with API usage.

**Thoughts**: Concerned that it's going to be hard to capture the quote randomly generated and tweet it verbatim to a particular user's Twitter account. So much to think through and much to learn to execute this, probably.

**Link to Work**:https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/entities and similar sections


###Day 19: Jan. 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Typed up and submitted ideas about web design in general to potential employer. Tried to use Justinmind on lunch break but needed more time to do anything with it. Am considering whether Tweet Button could be used instead of REST API. Must keep moving forward and not over-think or overdo projects.

**Thoughts**: "Done is better than perfect," as the saying goes.

**Link to work**: https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button


###Day 20: Jan. 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**:...was minimal. But also had a stressful evening and worked all day. Actually think I am almost there on figuring out how to tweet the quote. Some example projects have ideas that I can tweak to make mine work (I hope).

**Thoughts**: Need a day off to work uninterrupted. If I am here I'm "available" to my kids, partner, etc. Good thing I love them so much. <3 LOL

**Link to work**: https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button


###Day 21: Jan. 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally found helpful code examples of how to tweet the quote. Got a window to pop open. Still working on JS and HTML to get it right.

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to my days off to get wireframe and other things done!

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 22: Jan. 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Used Justinmind prototyping tool to finish and submit landing page mock-up to potential employer.

**Thoughts**: I never lose. I win or I learn. :)

**Link to work**: PrototypePBS.vp file downloaded. Uses Google Chrome Extension to render in browser.


###Day 23: Jan. 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to get help online with Random Quote Machine. Can generate quotes randomly but not click Tweet button after. Or, can click Tweet button first to open a window, but no quote in tweet field (because I can't do that first and have button clickable). Argh.

**Thoughts**: Speaking of Twitter, this whole exercise has totally upped my Twitter game and I am highly enjoying it. Great tool for professional networking and information.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 24: Jan. 21, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 25: Jan. 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 2+ hours at Free Code Camp Meetup. Shared my Random Quote Machine and got feedback/ideas for how to get unstuck on functionality.

**Thoughts**: Met more coding friends which is always a plus. :)

**Link to work**: This is the helpful Stack Overlow article Ash found that might fix my problems! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10486354/dynamically-change-tweet-button-data-text-contents


###Day 26: Jan. 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think I'm going to abandon the widget idea and go back to hyperlink for TWEETING THE STINKIN' QUOTE.

**Thoughts**: Worked at Starbucks on my lunch break. More reading and asking for help this evening. Sigh. Still doesn't work right.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq?editors=1010#0


###Day 27: Jan. 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hooray! Went to another Meetup through Girl Develop It and got feedback on RQM. I was so close to it populating the quote into the tweet field and two very nice developer mentors helped me get it working finally!

**Thoughts**: Grateful for helpful input. Also it made me feel better that it took lots of people a while to figure out why it wasn't working - so it wasn't just me. JavaScript is challenging for many people.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/egOxwq


###Day 28: Jan. 25, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 29: Jan. 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted RQM on Free Code Camp & got feedback on it. Went back into Coding Dojo's learning platform.

**Thoughts**: Not much accomplished today. Picked up son early and really should remember that if he's home it's hard to get coding done. But that's no excuse. I didn't manage my time very well today.

**Link to work**: http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/7/3728/25130 beginning assignment using Pokemon API for practice.


##Day 30: Jan. 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began writing code for Pokemon 1-156 images using PokeAPI assignment.

**Thoughts**:Some days are more challenging than others to carve out an hour to do this. PLus it takes self-discipline.

**Link to Work**: Have started a pokemonAPI.html file.


##Day 31: Jan. 28, 2017
**Day Off, my older two kids were in town!

##Day 32: Jan. 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**:...was minimal. Tried to work on Pokemon assignment in late evening. Bad idea.

**Thoughts**: I need to use the mornings for best work time. Need to be coding by 8:30 a.m. each day.

**Link to work**: http://pokeapi.co/ trying to use for loop to pull images from here.


##Day 33: Jan. 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: actually wrote lines of code and got out old notebook to try to use for loop JS logic to get html img to show images 1-151 without hard coding.

**Thoughts**: This sounded easy but it's not turning out to be that easy.

**Link to work**: http://pokeapi.co/ still using this API. Getting a lot of 404 errors because I can't populate the correct number in the string yet.


##Day 34: Jan 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked in cafe before starting Starbucks shift. Researched and tried various approaches to getting Pokemon to display.

**Thoughts**: Wasted a lot of time in traffic on my way to work. Wish there were more hours in the day. Looking forward to Thursday and Friday!

**Link to work**: still working on pokemonAPI.html file.


##Day 35: Feb. 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Found helpful article on Stack Overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16825964/create-and-load-images-using-a-loop-in-javascript. Still only able to work on coding about 1 hour before had to go to Starbucks.

**Thoughts**: I am grateful for my day job and just am having to code at odd hours of the day or it doesn't get done.

**Link to work**: http://pokeapi.co/ and above link.


##Day 36: Feb. 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had a day off from day job and so went to Coding Dojo to code. Figured out using for loop to display images from Pokeapi and got my CodePen working. Created helpful JSFiddle account. Also attended free webinar "How to Be A No-Brainer Tech Hire".

**Thoughts**: Feeling overwhelmed again. Must work more & harder at career reinvention. An hour or so per day isn't going to cut it.

**Link to work**: My finished Pokemon display site http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/WRzbNv


##Day 37: Feb. 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: At Coding Dojo again today. Began working on portfolio and had to iron out some Bootstrap template and theme ideas. Need to link own CSS to the file.

**Thoughts**: Feeling better about having clarity and moving forward with portfolio as priority 1.

**Link to work**: melissaPortfolio.html


##Day 38: Feb. 4, 2017 
**Day Off**


##Day 39: Feb. 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attended Free Code Camp Meetup and learned about React, Node and Express. Rethinking use of Bootstrap on portfolio. LOL

**Thoughts**: So much to learn still but it's great and I'm not alone.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/joshcode16/react-boilerplate.git cloned this and used during Meetup


##Day 40: Feb. 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Scrapped using Bootstrap on portfolio and switched to Materialize instead. Wanted to try something different and came highly recommended by Coding Dojo buddies.

**Thoughts**: While someday I would like to learn to do all of the CSS and so forth by hand, it definitely speeds up development of a portfolio page to use tools such as Materialize. I can customize it to be my own.

**Link to work**: Here is the Materialize info http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html


##Day 41: Feb 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: My brother, Brandon, helped me with melissa.work and created a logo for me along with a theme.

**Thoughts**: This saved me many steps and so I began implementing his suggestions. I love my logo!

**Link to work**: file:///C:/Users/melis/OneDrive/Documents/Melissa's%20Portfolio/melissa.work/index.html


##Day 42: Feb. 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded melissa.work folder and began customizing.

**Thoughts**: It takes time to write concisely about who I am, what I do, resize image to be 500x500 square, etc. But it's coming along.

**Link to work**: file:///C:/Users/melis/OneDrive/Documents/Melissa's%20Portfolio/melissa.work/index.html


##Day 43: Feb. 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on portfolio. Used Loom to record a video walk-through of "Girl, STEAM Your Story!"

**Thoughts**: I liked the video walk-through and just need someone to sign up for Loom to continue to access my video. Hopefully Brandon could help me out. LOL

**Link to work**: videoWalkThruGSYS.mp4


##Day 44: Feb. 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to pull in video into portfolio and it's not working. Also the video in the background stopped working. On the bright side, I visited Frederick Douglass Elementary in Dallas ISD today and learned more about how I might be able to help with volunteering and Code.org implementation.

**Thoughts**: Inspired by Shaz and Jess, and really hopeful that I will get a job soon. Goal is to finish portfolio project by Monday. Hoping to apply in earnest after that.

**Link to work**: Still on index.html for Melissa.Work


##Day 45: Feb. 11, 2017
Day Off


##Day 46: Feb. 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio more before going to church. Meetup this afternoon. Made a simple JavaScript quiz app.

**Thoughts** Learning through error-driven-development.

**Link to work**: Still on index.html for melissa.work. Trying out Pexels for free stock video backgrounds. 


##Day 47: Feb. 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I spent about two hours redoing my resume and then applying to Texas Instruments Digital Learning position, and also as a web content specialist with Ivie.

**Thoughts**: Back to my portfolio tomorrow!

**Link to work**: GuerreroResume2017.pdf


##Day 48: Feb. 14th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Got video background of portfolio working again, among other small things. Only had about 1 hour to code.

**Thoughts**: Coding takes time.

**Link to work**: melissa.work is coming together!


##Day 49: Feb. 15th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Redid Ninja Gold Game (the view, and the Pylot version) to make it cute for portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Need to record video walk-through of it now that it looks better. Also only had about 1 hour today to work.

**Link to work**: Pylot_Ninja_Gold folder on desktop 


##Day 50: Feb. 16th, 2017
Day Off


##Day 51: Feb. 17th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Revisited Ruby on Rails. Contacted by recruiter for job in Ft. Worth which I declined to pursue due to distance. Gave self pep talk. Will not get much or any coding done this weekend because I am going out of town. Made major revisions and edits to melissa.work and saved resume as .docx and .doc files.

**Thoughts**: CSS stylesheets are a blessing and a curse, because I have to figure out how to overcome inheritance, etc when styling the certain areas of my portfolio page without breaking other areas. 

**Link to work**: mainly still on melissa.work


##Day 52, 53, 54: Feb 18-20, 2017
Out of town in Arkansas visiting my kids - took time off for quality time with them!


##Day 55: Feb. 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Loom didn't work to record NInja Gold walk-through. Tried screen shot approach instead. Image distorted after I resized. Will continue figuring out making it look good at full page later. Frustrating.

**Thoughts** If things would work as planned the first time (non working Chrome extension!?) I wouldn't waste time inventing work-arounds.

**Link to work**: melissa.work still


##Day 56, 57: Feb. 22-23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I used morning coding time to apply for software developer jobs. These didn't list a portfolio requirement, so I applied now, and will keep working on my portfolio of course.

**Thoughts**: Thinking of going back to original works section and just highly modifying to fit their template because nothing is working and in the CSS the inheritance and styling can't be changed without breaking something else I like.

**Link to work**: applied to about 8 jobs in two mornings.


##Day 58: Feb. 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Brought back the Works section. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes templates save time and sometimes they make things harder than they have to be.

**Link to work**: file:///C:/Users/melis/OneDrive/Documents/Melissa's%20Portfolio/melissa.work/index.html


##Day 59: Feb. 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Melissa.work is done! But I was so excited to push it up to the remote host that I screwed something up by deleting the previous file and possibly placing a directory within a directory by mistake.

**Thoughts**: Gotta slow down and do things right. I should've asked Brandon for help before, and now he is helping me fix things after the fact.

**Link to work**: http://melissa.work


##Day 60, 61: Feb. 26-28, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Melissa.work is up and live! Got feedback, will consider and edit accordingly. Interview-type thing tomorrow at Creative Circle and internship follow up possibly too.

**Thoughts**: Bad cold Sunday, trying to get well, not much coding done, more job hunting instead.

**Link to work** http://melissa.work/


##Day 62: March 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Went for interview, applied for job, ran 5.2 miles, and started Free Code Camp's "Show the Local Weather" challenge. Have an internship interview Friday with a startup.

**Thoughts**: Have read that this is a tough challenge. Trying to plan carefully. Using geolocation and Open Weather API.

**Link to work**: http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/VpeQJa


##Day 63: March 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More with Weather App - specifically, reading through posts on forum about nightmares others have had and planning accordingly. Console is logging latitude and longitude as the value in a key-value pair, which I will have to split, capture, and then plug into the API call somehow.

**Thoughts**: This could get very tricky very quickly.

**Link to work**:http://codepen.io/Mmgfrog/pen/VpeQJa?editors=1111


##Day 64, 65, 66: March 3-5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More work on Weather App, job hunting, tookSaturday off, and attended 2 hours Free Code Camp Meetup.

**Thoughts**: Trying not to be afraid or get discouraged!

**Link to work**: same as above.


##Day 67: March 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: no code written, but had follow-ups from Digital Alchemy, Cineparty.co, and Creative Circle

**Thoughts**: DA is keeping me on file but no current openings, accepted Cineparty.co for part-time contract work, and will study for and take the three Creative Circle tests on HTML5, CSS3, and Ruby on Rails

**Link to work**: NA for today


##Day 68: March 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Applied for internship, wrote cover letter for internship oppotunities. More following up with above.

**Thoughts**: Off Wednesday and Thursday, so will be able to get much more done, although I am so grateful for Starbucks which helps pay the bills and has benefits

**Link to work**; InternshipCoverLetter.pdf


##Day 69 and 70: March 8-9, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Kahoot game for Sunday's Meetup and was made an admin for the group :D. Met Mohamed at Starbucks to download necessary components to begin working on Samsung TV app. Spent time reading through Samsung Dev UX info and making notes, joined Slack channel, joined Bitbucket for this project.

**Thoughts**: So much to do! Also need to study for and take HTML5, CSS# and Ruby on Rails tests for Creative Circle. Job hunting and replying/applying also needs attention. Need to make images into links on melissa.work based on feedback from three different ppl.

**Link to work**:http://developer.samsung.com/tv/design/design-principles


##Day 71: March 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Kept working my way through Samsung Dev Design seciton of documentation. Just want to make sure I am considering these things before I write any code and start getting into layouts, etc that won't work for this project/Smart TV.

**Thoughts**: Woke up really early for some reason, worked all day at Starbucks, went running, and then started coding stuff at the end of the day - not ideal

**Link to work**: same as above, Design Principles section


##Day 72: March 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More reading and note-taking on Samsung Dev Design in the morning, plus more study of JavaScript data types and subsequently making the Kahoot for Sunday's Free Code Camp Meetup.

**Thoughts**: So much information, so much to do and follow up with!

**Link to work**: getkahoot.com for the Data Types/Structures and Algorithms game. Finishing it tomorrow.


##Day 73: March 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished and presented the Kahoot at FCC Meetup (fun!). More notes and study of Samsung Design section.

**Thoughts**: Really grateful for my coding "tribe".

**Link to work**:http://developer.samsung.com/tv/design/media-player


##Day 74: March 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More notes aboutSamsung SmartTV design. Almost done with design section, then onto Develop which I hope talks a lot about Tizen.

**Thoughts**: I am procratinating moving the files but I don't want to dive into a project without TV App info in my mind. I want to take the time to do it right.

**Link to work**: Same Samsung Developer docs


##Day 75: March 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and looked closely at the 4 file folders within the Samsung Samrt TV app. Realized there are many duplicates. Asked about this, confirmed, and will begin refactoring project tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: This week is going to be out of whack because of Spring Break and schedule craziness.

**Link to work**: project folder(s)


##Day 76, 77: March 15-16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Wednesday, I finished reading through and taking notes on the Design section of the Samsung Developer documentation, and from 7-9 pm I attended a Women Who Code Meetup (it's Spring Break, Gabriel came with me and stayed up later than normal since we don't have school). Thursday, I got up early and attacked the file refactoring! I will Loom record my changes and send to Mohamed later for approval, plus to make sure that he doesn't need the .DS_Store files in the CSS subfolders before I delete the duplicate info. So now there is one CSS folder, one Views folder with the .html files in it, one Img folder, one JS folder, etc and deleted duplicated stuff because we don't need multiple copies of the same files in this project.

**Thoughts**: I know I am lacking confidence on this project but I think I just gotta go for it, sometimes. If I was wrong, I will work to fix any mistakes. But I think I am on the right track.

**Link to work**: project folders and Samsung documentation


##Day 78: March 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Git commit-ed my changes on my local branch to the Samsung Smart TV app! On Bitbucket!

**Thoughts**: I feel like a legit coder. This is a milestone. 

**Link to work**: Bitbucket repo, command line


##Days 79, 80, 81: March 18-20
Went to Arkansas to see the kids and then worked from 8:30-4:00 on Monday, so little to no coding progress made.


##Day 82: March 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Although my pull request couldn't be merged :(, the changes were mostly accepted and now we're onto the issue of HTML5 video tag and customizing it. Took a little time to straighten out/rebase using git and Bitbucket. Also, signed up for free MongoDB course, and using Lynda account to learn more about HTML5 video.

**Thoughts**: So much to do, and I am grateful for Starbucks but need to carve out more coding time.

**Link to work**: Here is the Lynda course https://www.lynda.com/HTML-5-tutorials/HTML5-Video-and-Audio-in-Depth/80781-2.html

##Day 83: March 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Skype call with Emily from Justinmind, then lots of work at Starbucks after lunch. Gave out business cards to Maya + Cory = phone interface updating site, and Linda = jewelry designer.

**Thoughts**: Whiteboard strategy is working. Plus good progress and info from Lynda.com course on HTML5 video and design

**Link to work**: https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/Understanding-HTML5-video-formats/80781/85003-4.html


##Day 84: March 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Went through next few sections of MongoDB for Devs course, tested out mongod (working) and mongo (working). Left off on App Architecture Overview section.

**Thoughts**: Glad I got through 54% of Lynda course yesterday. Will need to spend time this weekend. Honestly loving life right now, getting to do exercise, Mom, Starbucks, AND coding. God is so good and is really providing.

**Link to work**: MongoDB University course 101P


##Day 85: March 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Completed Lynda.com course on HTML5 Video and Audio In Depth. Very helpful!

**Thoughts**: Now onto actually writing the code for the project. Good to have background knowledge.

**Link to work**: Certificate of completion earned, posted on my LinkedIn profile


##Day 86: March 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Only a tiny bit of working on MongoDB course before I decided I need a nap. Pip intalled Bottle framework. Installing PyMongo next.

**Thoughts**: It's hard to code every single day. Iknow tomorrow afternoon I will work more on this stuff so I feel slightly less guilty.

**Link to work**: MongoDB + Python course


##Day 87: March 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Began working on the full_screen.html and full_screen.css to make the changes requested (HTML5 video tag instead, etc). Also attended Free Code Camp Dallas and did a lightning talk about HTML54 video and audio, encouraged people to use the Lynda.com resource for free with library account.

**Thoughts**: Making style changes in CSS is getting outside my comfort zone a little bit, especially with other people's CSS.

**Link to work**: Cineparty.co project folder


##Day 88: March 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Submitted three homework assignments for the MongoDB + Python course.

**Thoughts**: I am THAT student.

**Link to work**: https://university.mongodb.com/courses/MongoDB/M101P/2017_March/courseware/Chapter_1_Introduction/525480c9e2d4231cc6083fea/vertical_f993ca7aefeb


##Day 89, 90: March 28-29, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Limited progress with customizing the <video> controls. Downloaded mp4s to use to get buttons working.

**Thoughts**: It's almost like I have to overcome the existing CSS. Working with other people's code is challenging.

**Link to work**: Cineparty.co project folder


##Day 91, 92, 93: March 30-31, April 1
**Today's Progress**: More with MongoDB course. Cineparty.co contract revoked (they are hiring a full-time freelancer instead of part-time intern). Wasn't even a month, but honestly I learned a lot and it's a relief because it frees up time to get back on track with hunting for full-time jobs. I really feel God is shutting a door very clearly.

**Thoughts**: Long talk with Scott. Trying new direction with job applications. I have not submitted a resume lately and that's bad.

**Link to work**: Googled "Top 25 Employers in Dallas" and started investigating whether they are hiring. Need to rework resume too.


##Day 94: April 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 2 hours Free Code Camp Meetup where we worked on building the Show the Local Weather App exercise. Then another hour or so after I worked on the MongoDB course.

**Thoughts**: So thankful for group of coding buddies and also time to work.

##Day 95: April 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Applied to several jobs and then spent tie on MongoDB course. Doubtful that I will have HW done by tomorrow at noon but will try very hard!

**Thoughts** This was a long coursework section.

**Link to work**: Tutorial for MOngoDB, creating_school.js, using_find.py, etc.
